# ML-Reinforcement-learning

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.

The ML model is built based on two methods:
 <ol>
  <li> Thompson Sampling </li>
  <li> Upper Confidence Bound </li>
  </ol>
  
  The dataset defines the AD CTR (Click-Through Rate) of a website. The ML models respectively predict the ad which was clicked by the user the most.
  
  The final predictions are represented on a histogram and it was found that ad 5 was clicked the most.
